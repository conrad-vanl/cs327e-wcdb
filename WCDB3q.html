Doubts over the strength of the relationship between the European states and the United States ebbed and flowed, along with doubts over the credibility of the NATO defence against a prospective Soviet invasion doubts that led to the development of the independent French nuclear deterrent and the withdrawal of the French from NATO's military structure in 1966.</TD><TD></TD><TD></TD><TD></TD><TD></TD><TD>Brussels</TD><TD></TD><TD>1110</TD><TD>Belgium</TD></TR><TR><TD>NG</TD><TD>National Guard of the United States</TD><TD>MO</TD><TD>It has helped out in most major world crises.</TD><TD>7036072584</TD><TD>7036072584</TD><TD>nationalguard@ng.com</TD><TD>111 S.
