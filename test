The treaty and the Soviet Berlin Blockade led to the creation of the Western European Union's Defence Organization in September 1948. However, participation of the United States was thought necessary both to counter the military power of the USSR and to prevent the revival of nationalist militarism, so talks for a new military alliance began almost immediately resulting in the North Atlantic Treaty, which was signed in Washington, D.C. on 4 April 1949. It included the five Treaty of Brussels states plus the United States, Canada, Portugal, Italy, Norway, Denmark and Iceland. Popular support for the Treaty was not unanimous, and some Icelanders participated in a pro-neutrality, anti-membership riot in March 1949.</History><ContactInfo><Telephone>+32 2 707 50 33</Telephone><PostalAddress><StreetAddress>1110 Brussels</StreetAddress><Country>Belgium</Country></PostalAddress></ContactInfo><Kind organizationKindIdent="MA" /></Organization><Organization organizationIdent="CIA"><Name>Central Intelligence Agency</Name><History>The Central Intelligence Agency was created by Congress with the passage of the National Security Act of 1947, signed into law by President Harry S.

Eleven months earlier, in 1944, William J. Donovan, the OSS's creator, proposed to President Franklin D. Roosevelt to create a new organization directly supervised by the President: "which will procure intelligence both by overt and covert methods and will at the same time provide intelligence guidance, determine national intelligence objectives, and correlate the intelligence material collected by all government agencies." Under his plan, a powerful, centralized civilian agency would have coordinated all the intelligence services. He also proposed that this agency have authority to conduct "subversive operations abroad," but "no police or law enforcement functions, either at home or abroad."</History><ContactInfo><Telephone>703 482 0632</Telephone><Fax>703 482 1739</Fax><PostalAddress><StreetAddress>Central Intelligence Agency, Office of Public Affairs</StreetAddress><Locality>Washington</Locality><Region>D.C.</Region><PostalCode>20505</PostalCode><Country>United States</Country></PostalAddress></ContactInfo><Kind organizationKindIdent="IA" /></Organization><Organization organizationIdent="HAMAS"><Name>Hamas</Name><History>With its takeover of Gaza after the 1967 war with Egypt, Israel hunted down secular Palestinian Liberation Organization factions but dropped the previous Egyptian rulers' harsh restrictions against Islamic activists.
